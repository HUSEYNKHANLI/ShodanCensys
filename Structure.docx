1. Imports:
The script requires several libraries to function:
OS Module: For interacting with the operating system.
shodan: A Python client for the Shodan API.
re: The regular expression library.
requests: For making HTTP requests.
json: To encode and decode JSON data.
csv: To read from and write to CSV files.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping.
argparse: To parse command line arguments.
logging: For logging information, warnings, and errors.
censys.search: A Python client for the Censys API.
ThreadPoolExecutor: For parallelizing tasks.
decouple: For configuration management, typically to get environment variables.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
2. Logging Setup:
The script sets up logging to display messages. The level set to INFO means it will display all messages of level INFO and above (WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL).
3. Argument Parsing:
The script expects a 'target' argument from the command line. This target will be the subject of the searches.
pythonCopy code
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Search for a target using Shodan, Censys, and Google.")
parser.add_argument('target', type=str, help="The target you want to search for.")
args = parser.parse_args()
target = args.target
4. Censys API Initialization:
The script initializes the Censys API using credentials. The config function from the decouple library retrieves these credentials, likely from an environment variable or a configuration file.
5. Functions:
A brief overview of the main functions:
 
search_censys(target):
 
This function uses the Censys API to search for the target. It returns a list of results or an empty list if there's an error.
 
update_patterns(new_pattern) & load_patterns():
 
These functions manage a patterns file (likely containing search patterns). The update_patterns function adds a new pattern to this file, and load_patterns loads existing patterns or generates new ones.
 
search_banner_keywords_with_google(target):
 
This function seems to use Google to search for keywords in banners. However, due to the truncation, the full details of how it does this are not clear.
 
plot_country_distribution(data):
 
This function takes in data (likely the search results) and visualizes the distribution of IP addresses by country using a bar chart.
6. Main Execution:
In the main section of the script:
Patterns (search queries or filters) are loaded or generated.
The ThreadPoolExecutor is used to run searches on Shodan and Censys concurrently. This speeds up the search process by running them in parallel.
The results from Shodan and Censys are processed, and some of them seem to be saved to JSON and CSV files.
Finally, the distribution of IPs by country is visualized using the plot_country_distribution function.
This script seems to be a tool for cybersecurity or network research, leveraging popular platforms like Shodan and Censys to gather data about a specific target and then analyzing and visualizing that data.
